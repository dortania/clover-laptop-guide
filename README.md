## Hackintosh on a Laptop is Hard

Are you really up for the challenge? Do you look forward to the coming weeks of studying documentation, reading source code, troubleshooting problems, and staying up all night because you've almost got your Hackintosh working just to find out that your change wasn't quite right?

If you've answered yes to all of those questions, congratulations you may have what it takes to Hackintosh a laptop! If you've said no, well thank you for coming by anyway and congratulations on the new Macbook Pro that you're about to purchase instead!

Oh, you're still here? GREAT! Over the next few days or weeks \(possibly months\) you will learn all of the ins and outs of what makes macOS work on a Laptop. This guide, should you choose to continue reading will help you by providing some basic information, and pointers to help you as you embark on your journey.

On that note, while it's impossible to personally thank everyone in the community; I do want to specifically thank the following people for their help and their contributions to myself, to this guide, and to the community. This guide would not have been possible without their guidance, and their knowledge.
